Paris In The Spring
Ray Noble 
(Gordon-Revel)
"Paris in Spring"

Paris In The Spring, Mm---Mm---
Love is in the air,  Mm---Mm---
Life's a love affair
And ev'ry pair of arms a rendesvous for two.

Paris In The Spring, Mm---Mm---
Hearts begin to dance, Mm---Mm---
And in ev'ry glance you'll find
An invitation to romance.

You must fall.
You simply can't evade love.
The moon is there to aid love
Find someone you can call you own.

You're to blame if you're alone  Mm---
It's grand, it's new, Mm---
It's me, it's you
Ev'ry beating heart becomes a part of 
Paris In The Spring.
