This cementery is located near the small Town of Pamlico, I think in
Craven Cty. My Mother and I visited it in the early 80s.  It is off a
logging road and the area is extremely overgrown.  We had an eldery
gentleman hack out a path with a machete. It's located on Broad Creek,
which ,I think is a tributary of the Neuse River.

I've arranged the list in order of death:
