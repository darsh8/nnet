"The real must for everybody who is a fan and lover of Jim Morrison's poetry. This CD contains Jim Morrison's complete first poetry session before Paul Rothchild cut it up into little pieces to see what could be used for the Elektra release An American Prayer ( this Rothchild version was stolen from his desk and used for many bootlegs, including the LP Rock Is Dead (Tangie Town Records), and Orange County Suite (Document Records DR 019), to name the best ones) and also the complete tape Jim recorded in Paris with two unknown street musicians (see The Doors Quarterly #32 for the complete transcript). The content of both tapes was - as rumors go - taken via DAT recorder from the original master Jim had with him in Paris (see The Doors Quarterly #31 for the complete story of The Lost Paris Tapes). I had the chance to listen to the original reel-to-reels before they were sold to a collector in Germany and I compared the length of the reel tape to the one on the CD - no difference.
When I say complete, I mean uncut. And this is the most important thing about this CD - sure: some of the poems have been published on countless bootlegs before, but in worse quality and - cut. On this CD you can hear Jim pouring some liquid (I guess it wasn't mineral water) into a glass, you hear him turning pages, lightening matches, asking how much time was left and so on and on. On Radio Dark Night (Take 1) the engineer (John Haeny) made a mistake (he recorded it using a filter) so this track had to be recorded twice (I'm surprised he didn't rewind the tape). The biggest surprise on this CD is the uncut version of Orange County Suite which Jim did during the poetry session. We all know from previous releases the first part of this swan song to Pamela Courson, but nobody ever heard the complete recording like it was printed in Jim's poetry collection Wilderness. It's fun to check Wilderness and The American Night for the poems featured on this CD. It's no fun to check what parts of the poems had been cut out for An American Prayer, what great material hadn't been used and what poems had been cut together. This CD is an ideal source to see how Jim really worked, how he intended his poetry to be cut on tape, carefully choosing word for word, intonation and volume of his voice. This is the real thing, fans, in excellent quality, and the perfect addition to the recently released official poetry album An American Prayer.
Well, the 14-minute Paris session is a real tough one! Undoubtedly, the band named Jomo And The Smoothies were drunk. Or they were on another substance, nobody knows. And they were bad! As bad as any other amateur band being drunk in a studio. I don't know what kind of instrument one of the guys has, certainly one using strings to produce a sound - but he's not even able to tune it! (Jim seems to be amused ...)
Every song the "guitarist" suggests fails - Jim doesn't know them (I'm the singer ...). So finally, after some funny chats, they stumble into a weird version of Orange County Suite (compare it to the version taped during the poetry session!). Jim forgets the words, shouts out loud the ones he remembers, mixes them up - booze ...
So - what's so interesting about those 14 minutes? Well, this is most likely the last thing Jim ever recorded, and it is probably the only thing he recorded while being in Paris. A true document from his last days - remember, the man died 2 weeks later! And - it wasn't a planned thing - it was done on the spot using a pseudonym (Jomo And The Smoothies). And - this CD was made from the original tape (as the liner notes say), so it is in the best quality you could imagine. And - it's new! Finally a new, totally unpublished recording that might survive as a piece of history in Jim Morrison's story, presented on this CD in superb sound quality. The first pressing came with a colour picture CD, the second pressing came with a black and white CD. The soundquality is the same.
As the liner notes from the booklet say - this is Jim Morrison's one and only solo album, and it's right - no other bootleg album is better and more intense than The Lost Paris Tapes. A nice booklet using some of Alain Ronay's photos from a village near Chantilly (taken a few days before Jim died) is included, and this one also features two photos of the original boxes which preserved the two tapes.
In general - this CD is an absolute MUST for each fan, and it is highly RECOMMENDED!"
